#Full name greeting. Write a program that asks for a person’s first name,
#then middle, and then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their
#full name.

#first name
puts 'what is your first name?'

first_name = gets.chomp


#middle name

puts 'what is your middle name?'

middle_name = gets.chomp


#last name

puts 'what is your last name?'

puts 'great to meet you, ' + name + '.



#Bigger, better favorite number. Write a program that asks for a person’s
#favorite number. Have your program add 1 to the number, and then
#suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful
#about it, though.)


#favorite number
puts 'what is your favorite number?'

favorite_number = gets.chomp



#bigger better number

puts 'I have an even better favorite number ' + (fav_number.to_i + 1)_s + '  ?'
